# 0.1.0 (2018-12-09)

### Bug Fixes

- compile to es2015 to support older nodes ([21b2ed2](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-puppeteer/commit/21b2ed2))
- do not depend on `puppeteer-core` ([c3f0ec9](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-puppeteer/commit/c3f0ec9))
- **package-lock:** do not point at a private registry ([bf94ba5](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-puppeteer/commit/bf94ba5))

### Features

- Initial implementation ([#2](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-puppeteer/issues/2)) ([ee39774](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-puppeteer/commit/ee39774))
